# Spotify_Project
This was one of the first smaller applications I've built for fun during my spare time. This project was meant for the learning experience of how to utilize public
API's, for example the Spotify public API used in this project. I was also exposed to Express.js for the first time as I used it as my back end framework with Node.js.
This simple application also required a database to store songs, so the songs would be stored for future uses.

# Tools
React, JavaScript, Express, MySQL
